sofia-sip (1.12.11+20110422-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the 1.12.11 release, SOATAG_LOCAL_SDP_STR_REF is broken (but that is
    fixed in commmit bcd0f17f), so let's take a snapshot off HEAD for now.

sofia-sip (1.12.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New faces.  Thanks for your work on this one George!
  * Replace cdbs with a sensible rules file.  Fixes many bugs, including the
    double pass of doxgen attributed to Some Reason in the ancient TODO.Debian,
    and Closes: #595526 (the missing sip_extra.h header).
  * We don't appear to have any remaining problems with unresolved symbols now,
    Closes: #558959

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 01 May 2011 01:11:11 +0930

      libsofia-sip-ua0.symbols.mipsel
  * Remove empty symbol files for unofficial architectures (will
    be added eventually later as access to such buildd logs is available):
      libsofia-sip-ua0.symbols.kfreebsd-i386
      libsofia-sip-ua0.symbols.kfreebsd-amd64
  * fix copyright link to point to LGPL-2.1 (though sources mention

  * Fix the header of libsofia-sip-ua-glib3.symbols (Closes: #512699)

      libsofia-sip-ua0.symbols.armel

sofia-sip (1.12.10-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * added symbol files: libsofia-sip-ua-glib3.symbols and
    libsofia-sip-ua0.symbols.ARCH (only i386 is currently 
    done, the rest would need the diffs of autobuilders logs) 
  * libsofia-sip-ua-glib0.install removed, no such package anymore
  * added DEB_DH_MAKESHLIBS_ARGS_ALL := -- -c4
  * get-orig-source: change wget options to

sofia-sip (1.12.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Kai Vehmanen ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Contains fix to the memory leak bug in 1.12.7. (Closes: #452386)

 -- Kai Vehmanen <kai.vehmanen@nokia.com>  Thu, 24 Jan 2008 18:52:36 +0200

sofia-sip (1.12.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

 -- Mark Purcell <msp@debian.org>  Sun, 21 Oct 2007 13:37:54 +0100

sofia-sip (1.12.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Kai Vehmanen ]
  * Set DEB_* variables after including CDBS macros, not before.
  * The "--as-needed" linked option is now explicitly disabled (was
    enabled before, but didn't work as it was in the wrong place).
  * CDBS clean target was set to "clean". See
    http://www.bononia.it/~zack/blog/posts/2007/09/clean_distclean.html.
    (Closes: #442732)
  * Another fix related to #442732: remove the doxygen output directories
    in clean target. In upstream, the doxygen targets are not run
    by default, so also the cleaning has to be done separately.

sofia-sip (1.12.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Kai Vehmanen ]
  * Fixed inclusion of libsofia-sip-ua-glib3.so library to the
    packages. Closes bug #419559.

sofia-sip (1.12.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Kai Vehmanen ]
  * New upstream release
    See the release notes at:
    http://www.mail-archive.com/sofia-sip-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01286.html
  * Note that libsofia-sip-ua-glib ABI has changed, so libsofia-ua-glib3 replaces
    libsofia-sip-ua-glib0. This is not a major change however, as this library
    was not part of the stable set of interfaces, and no applications in Debian have
    yet used the -glib0 library.
  * Relaxed dependency from sofia-sip-bin to libsofia-sip-ua0 (allow newer versions
    of the library).

 -- Mark Purcell <msp@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Mar 2007 22:36:20 +0100

    be added back to the package.

sofia-sip (1.12.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Rémi Denis-Courmont ]
  * Added dependency to autotools-dev so that CDBS can update config.{guess,sub},
    and to libc headers
  * Fine-tuned libsofia-sip-ua-glib-dev dependencies.
  * Added '-z defs' linker flag to verify no undefined symbols go unnoticed.
  * Added '--as-needed' linker flag to remove extraneous .so's from list of
    needed libraries.

  [ Kai Vehmanen ]

    have ssl disabled in the resulting packages.

  [ George Danchev ]
  * Use new variables for binNMU-safety (as of dpkg-dev >= 1.13.19)

  [ Mark Purcell ]

    libsofia-sip-ua0, libsofia-sip-ua-glib0 as suggested by libpkg-guide#5
  * Version Build-Depends for debhelper level4 as suggested by cdbs docs
  * Added watch file and TODO.Debian
  * Adjusted maintainer and uploaders fields
  * Split-off a sofia-sip-doc package
  * Build-Depends on graphviz since /ust/bin/dot is needed at build time
