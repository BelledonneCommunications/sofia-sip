Description: Sofia-SIP library utilities
 Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library, compliant
 with the IETF RFC3261 specification. It can be used as
 a building block for SIP client software for uses such as VoIP,
 IM, and many other real-time and person-to-person communication
 services.
 .
 This package provides a set of console tools and helper
 applications for use in scripts, testing and other uses. All
 the tools utilize the Sofia-SIP library.
